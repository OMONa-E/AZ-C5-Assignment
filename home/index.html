            <p>A <b>front-end developer</b> creates websites and applications using web languages such as <i>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</i> that allow users to access and interact with the site or app. When you visit a website, the design elements you see were created by a front-end developer.</p>
            <p>If someone wanted to build a website, they might hire a front-end developer to create the site's layout. The front-end developer determines where to place images, what the navigation should look like, and how to present the site. Much of their work involves ensuring the <code>appearance and layout</code> of the site or application is easy to navigate and intuitive for the user.</p>
